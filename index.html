                In the current climate of ever increasing stress, cut throat competition, and increasing consumerism, it

                for any of us to encounter social, personal, or academic problems. The constant pressure and expectation
                from oneself

                mind.

                Saathi, the counselling service of IIT Guwahati, has experienced counsellors and a dedicated team who
                are ready to take
                the responsibility of guiding and supporting the students in their path towards success and
                self-fulfillment. This
                includes handling personal, family and peer problems as well as managing academics more responsibly.

                The counsellors provide a comfortable and confidential environment where the students feel at ease to
                discuss anything
                that may be bothering them, and help find solution to their problems.

                WHY IS COUNSELLING REQUIRED?
                Institutions such as IIT serve as a great place for higher learning and maximum life exposure to all,
                but at the same
                time it brings along some inevitable pressures from unexpected areas. Many thrive on the challenges of
                this stimulating
                environment, but at times people become tired, overwhelmed, irritable, anxious or depressed. In such
                matters, typically
                people struggle with their issues internally, mulling them over in their mind trying to sort out
                possible solutions to
                their dilemmas. They may speak with family members and friends, but they may feel it is not enough. At
                this stage, it is
                reasonable as well as crucial to speak with a counsellor.
