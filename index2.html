          <h1>Welcome to Saathi Club of IITG</h1>
          <p>
            "Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to
            succeed is always to try just one more time."<br />
            In the current climate of ever increasing stress, cut throat
            competition, and increasing consumerism, it is only natural for any
            of us to encounter social, personal, or academic problems. The
            constant pressure and expectation from oneself and significant
            others often leads to emotional or psychological turmoil, thus
            disturbing the peace of mind. <br />
            When one is away from his/her comfort zone, a mentor, a counsellor,
            a saathi emerges as ‘a shelter in the storm’. Saathi, the
            counselling service of IIT Guwahati, has experienced counsellors and
            a dedicated team who are ready to take the responsibility of guiding
            and supporting the students in their path towards success and
            self-fulfillment. This includes handling personal, family and peer
            problems as well as managing academics more responsibly.<br />

            counsellors provide a comfortable and confidential environment where
            the students feel at ease to discuss anything that may be bothering
            them, and help find solution to their problems.<br />
          </p>
          <h3>WHY IS COUNSELLING REQUIRED?</h3>
          <p>
            Institutions such as IIT serve as a great place for higher learning
            and maximum life exposure to all, but at the same time it brings
            along some inevitable pressures from unexpected areas. Many thrive
            on the challenges of this stimulating environment, but at times
            people become tired, overwhelmed, irritable, anxious or depressed.
            In such matters, typically people struggle with their issues
            internally, mulling them over in their mind trying to sort out
            possible solutions to their dilemmas. They may speak with family
            members and friends, but they may feel it is not enough. At this
            stage, it is reasonable as well as crucial to speak with a
            counsellor.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT IS COUNSELLING?</h3>
          <p>
            Counselling is an interactive process characterized by a unique
            relationship between counsellor and client that leads to change in
            the client in one or more of the following areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Behaviour (overt changes in the ways clients’ act, their coping
              skills, decision making skills, and/or relationship skills)
            </li>
            <li>
              Beliefs and values (ways of thinking about self, others, and the
              world) or emotional concerns relating to these perceptions
            </li>
            <li>
              Level of emotional distress (uncomfortable feelings or reactivity
              to environmental stress).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The counselling process is conducted with an accurate empathetic
            understanding, unconditional positive regard and genuineness towards
            the clients’ condition in a non-judgemental, confidential and
            mutually respectful manner.
          </p>

          <h3>SOME COMMON MISCOCEPTION ABOUT COUNSELLING</h3>
          <p>
            Many people have pre – conceived ideas or no idea of what
            counselling is about. Usually these ideas include some myths or
            misconceptions which may induce doubts in people’s mind and proves
            to be a hindrance in getting the help they need and deserve. Three
            of the most common myth prevailing in the campus is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>MYTH</strong>: If I go for counselling people will think I
              am crazy or mentally ill.<br /><strong>REALITY</strong>: The vast
              majorities of people who undergo counselling are usually the ones
              experiencing some difficulties and problems in their day to day
              life which makes their stress overwhelming and make them unable to
              cope with the pressures of life. Clients come from all walks of
              life and from variety of occupations.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>MYTH</strong>: To seek counselling is a sign of my
              weakness.<br /><strong>REALITY</strong>: This mentality has
              originated from a subtle subconscious message prevalent in the
              society that men are supposed to be strong, both physically as
              well as emotionally. This usually results into men trying to keep
              their feelings hidden and internalize their pain even at the cost
              of their emotional health. In such a situation if the person is
              attempting to address his problem by seeking counselling it is
              certainly a sign of emotional strength and courage rather than
              weakness.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>MYTH</strong>: People (teachers/ friends/ parents) will
              know that I went for counselling. <br /><strong>REALITY</strong>:
              Counselling is a confidential arrangement between the client and
              the counsellor. A counsellor will not release information to
              anybody without taking prior permission from the client. Only
              those people will come to know whom the client themselves decides
              to tell.
